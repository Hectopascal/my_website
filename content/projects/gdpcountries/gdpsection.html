<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports).</p>

<p>From the chart above we can see that for all 3 countries Net Exports represents the smallest component of GDP, and vice versa, Household expenditure is the largest but its worthwhile that the latter has evolved differently in time across these countries (rising in the US, decreasing in India and plateauing in Germany). Gross capital formation has been rising sharply in India since 2000, whilst it has remained relatively constant in the US and Germany. Government expenditure instead has been fairly constant across all 3 countries, with a slight decline for the US and it has the same weight on GDP as Gross Capital formation for US and Germany, whilst it is much smaller component for India.</p>
<p>Next, we note that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports) and calculate it as follows.</p>

  mutate(TotGDP = `Household expenditure`+ `Government expenditure`+ `Net_Exports` + `Gross capital formation`) %&gt;%
  select(2,3,11, 22) %&gt;%
  mutate(Percentage_Difference = (`TotGDP`-`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)/`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`*100)

<p>The percentage difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe varies from country to country and from year to year. However, we observe that the average difference in 2017 was, on average, less than 1%. When looking more closely at a handful of countries it becomes evident that there are exceptions, such as with Afghanistan, which has a % difference of 31%.</p>
<p>Plotting the same graph for my home country Singapore, we can see that the imports and exports represent the largest component of the GDP in Singapore, which has been on a sharp increase since 1990s. In comparison, the rest of the components have remained relatively constant.</p>
